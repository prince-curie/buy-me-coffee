# Buy Me Coffee

A side project in the manner of the popular Buy Me A Coffee website where anyone can create a landing page, where anyone can send them some amount of money as a thankuou for their services.

The only side is that every user must own a bank account and a credit/debit card. 

To combat this down side we built on top of the blockchain to enable anyone around to the world to access the the app with using an ethereum wallet.
